    <h2>ARTS AND CUBE TECHNIQUES</h2>
    <p> It was the first channel started by me on 2021 on covid pendemic holidays. I made this channel to share my creativity on social media. This channel consists of both Arts and cube videos. You can find this channe by typing "Arts of zane". </p>
    <p>Through this channel I never teachs how to make a drawing or to solve the cube. I only uploaded the videos of drawing which I had already made before. I thought it would be time consuming to teach those drawings how to make. </p>
    <p>But after a few days I Stopped uploading videos as there was no one to see these arts there was a long break on my channel but one day when I was scrolling down the shorts on youtube. There I got an idea to upload a short video on youtube shorts. On that day I uploaded my first drawing on youtube. </p>
    <p>On that day I got twice the views I got on my videos I beacame very happy as I got this much views for first time so, I  started uploading shorts once a week or once a month, now a days also sometimes I uploads the video but you can't find many videos on my channel beacause I never get time to upload or to make the drawings.</p>
   <p>Which also sometimes negatively effect my channel as it goes to freeze. while knowing all these disadvantages I never stoped uploading as I need to share my creativity to whole world.</p>

<h4>SOFTWARES</h4>
   <p> There are  No. of websites from which you can download your softwares. I also use the softwares to make the graphics and video better. I generally use the softwares for editting the videos and programming as they make our work better. I also use apps to edit the small videos which you can find on my arts and cube technique channel.</P>
<p>  In this channel I usualy editted my videos on apps or editted directly from youtube. You can also downlad the softwares which you can find on their softwares particular website. I useualy use getintopc website as It contains many softwares in it.</p>
<p>It is not nesecery that you can find the softwares on websites for free beacause there are many softwares which you need to pay.</p>
